It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?

When I showed him how my irrigation box was leaking, he knew right away what to do - he went a grabbed a new part out of his truck, put it on, and it was fixed! He then set up my watering timer and we talked about some landscaping and pricing. His prices seemed great and I will definitely use him in the future! To top it all off, when I asked him what I owed him for fixing my irrigation leak and his time, he said don't worry about it! I was shocked and couldn't believe his service!

I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \\\"\"Are you working?\\\"\" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\\n\\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down.

I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.\n\n\n[Succeeded / Failed / Skipped / Total] 9 / 0 / 0 / 9:  10%| | 10/100 [00:29<04:2--------------------------------------------- Result 10 ---------------------------------------------\n\u001b[92m2 (93%)\u001b[0m --> \u001b[91m1 (54%)\u001b[0m\n\nLike any Barnes & Noble, it has a nice comfy cafe, and a large selection of books.

Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender.

I'm just not a fan of mustard!\\n\\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote.

Small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato, slither of zucchini, and a stem of green onion, but the star afterall was the lamb, and it was meduim perfect, just as I ordered!  \\n\\\"\"Would you care for some dessert?\\\"\", Ramon, our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked.  And so round 3 begins.  Coffee, a chocolate mousse with whip cream, beauty and...  their version of creme brulee.  I thought it had a hint of peanut butter, but not sure.  Regardless it was  so, so divine.\\nThis place was busy but we did not feel rushed, unlike most places.  The service was great, the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered.  We shall return.\\nFinally, on an end note. Cafe Zinho is BYOB, so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.  And they only take cash or personal check, but they do have an ATM.\n\n\n[Succeeded / Failed / Skipped / Total] 46 / 0 / 1 / 47:  47%|▍| 47/100 [01:19<01--------------------------------------------- Result 48 ---------------------------------------------\n\u001b[91m1 (100%)\u001b[0m --> \u001b[92m2 (52%)\u001b[0m\n\nAnd so....the search for a new hair salon continues. \u001b[91mSigh\u001b[0m.

I went in with the intention of buying a jacket, helmet and gloves. Their store is pretty nice inside, and they have a good selection of gear (mostly dirt-oriented though). \\n\\nI wasn't quite sure what I wanted, so I asked a lady for some assistance in picking out a helmet. She was helpful, and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather. However, a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket (which they also sold), and she commented that the \\\"\"hated\\\"\" that jacket and that the liner was \\\"\"nothing more than a glorified garbage bag.\\\"\" Ok...\\n\\nWe also talked to a guy at the register about a '96 KTM 300 MXC that my friend just bought, and asked a simple question about a clutch cable. The guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless, and I'm not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was. He ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old. What!?\\n\\nEven after that, I still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet I liked that they had assured me would be in later that week. I then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available, but that I could pick another style. I then just ordered the helmet online and went back the next day to get a refund.\\n\\nI wanted to like this place, but between the thinly-veiled insults and seemingly clueless repair staff, I don't think I'll ever return. Their prices and selection are pretty decent, so if you are in the area and know what you want, it might be OK to stop by and pick something up. If you have any alternative, though, I would avoid this place.\n\n\n[Succeeded / Failed / Skipped / Total] 50 / 0 / 2 / 52:  53%|▌| 53/100 [01:28<01--------------------------------------------- Result 53 ---------------------------------------------\n\u001b[92m2 (100%)\u001b[0m --> \u001b[91m1 (91%)\u001b[0m\n\n\u001b[92mFun\u001b[0m bar, and instead of \u001b[92mtypical\u001b[0m bar food they lean towards Greek dishes.

My great grandmother's sauce was the first I remember, she never opened a can to make her sauces, always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars. She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later adding whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.\\n\\nSorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No! I will admit it's good in a fit of really, REALLY needing a pasta fix, or if you want to eat breadstick and salad. But the sauces are overly rich, and I don't mean the tomato sauces. I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken, beef or fish. And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.\\n\\nOkay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers. But seriously, if you want good Italian food, hit up a REALLY good neighborhood, family owned Italian restaurant. The service is better, it will be cheaper and it won't go to a big conglomerate who over charges on a plate of pasta, which is one of the cheapest food you can serve. Oh, two stars for a pretty good bowl of Pasta Fazoo (pasta and beans).\n\n\n[Succeeded / Failed / Skipped / Total] 77 / 1 / 4 / 82:  83%|▊| 83/100 [01:54<00--------------------------------------------- Result 83 ---------------------------------------------\n\u001b[92m2 (100%)\u001b[0m --> \u001b[91m1 (76%)\u001b[0m\n\n\u001b[92mGreat\u001b[0m bagels, sandwiches, soup, and coffee!\\nMy \u001b[92mfavorites\u001b[0m are the veg-out bagel sandwich, the bagel dog on onion, and their sour cream potato salad is so good too.\\nIf you like all beef hotdogs, you should try the bagel dog.

However, I can order a salad with FRENCH FRIES on it.  Seriously?  The salad was fine, by the way, and is a large portion but knowing  that tons of calories had to be consumed just to get a vegetable in me was disappointing.\\n\\nOn the bright side, the smoked turkey wrap, which comes with havarti cheese and cranberry sauce was ridiculously good.

Want some good people watching?  Sit and watch people try to get from one to the other without realizing you need a key.  Ridiculous.  Since you can access each of these places without a key from other doors, this does not make any sense.

Why does it seem that Pittsburgh wants to thrive on fatty, flavorless food?\\n\\nUpon ordering the caesar salad on New Year's Eve, I was told that the restaurant has no non- or low-fat dressing option...at all.  However, I can order a salad with FRENCH FRIES on it.  Seriously?  The salad was fine, by the way, and is a large portion but knowing  that tons of calories had to be consumed just to get a vegetable in me was disappointing.\\n\\nOn the bright side, the smoked turkey wrap, which comes with havarti cheese and cranberry sauce was ridiculously good.  The turkey was juicy and melded perfectly with the cheese and cranberries.  That I could eat again and it would  fill me up all day.\\n\\nI also sampled the buffalo pierogies and really just found them to be the Mrs. T's ones with Frank's Hot Sauce on them.  They were good, but uncreative considering the price ($8.99).\\n\\nThe drinks here are decently priced and pretty good.  Friends I was with sampled a few of the drinks on the interesting cocktail menu and were happy with their choices...they were strong drinks.  When my co-worker and I arrived though one night to dine here, we were not offered cocktail menus so I just stuck with wine until I was no longer in the mood for a cocktail.  \\n\\nService on New Year's Eve was apathetic.  Granted, the place was packed, but we had  to wait for silverware and had our food and drinks pretty much thrown at us.  Even when it slowed down we were barely paid attention to and were hardly treated with any amount of friendliness even though numerous drinks and food orders were made.\\n\\nThere are a ton of TVs here, so it is a great spot to watch a game.  Even during busy times, there is a space for you but it will take a while to flag down a server to seat you if you want to sit.  \\n\\nI think I would stop back here if I find myself at the Springhill Suites again, but I definitely would not go out of my way to dine here.  Can't win 'em all, right?  \\n\\nPro-tip:  You can not access the restaurant from the hotel it is attached to (Springhill Suites) without a key and you can not leave the restaurant to get into the hotel without one.  Want some good people watching?  Sit and watch people try to get from one to the other without realizing you need a key.  Ridiculous.  Since you can access each of these places without a key from other doors, this does not make any sense.  But, it is what it is so do not forget your key!\n\n\n[Succeeded / Failed / Skipped / Total] 82 / 1 / 4 / 87:  87%|▊| 87/100 [02:01<00--------------------------------------------- Result 88 ---------------------------------------------\n\u001b[91m1 (100%)\u001b[0m --> \u001b[92m2 (52%)\u001b[0m\n\nDIDN'T \u001b[91mEAT\u001b[0m \u001b[91mHERE\u001b[0m...this review not about the \u001b[91mfood\u001b[0m.

Instead of running school buses, the school district gave high schoolers bus passes to get to class, and I have used the bus since 1997.\\n\\nI've had a great experience using the bus in Pittsburgh. I didn't get a driver's license until I was almost 19--the bus (\\\"\"Miss Pat\\\"\"--another nickname) and my bike got me everywhere I needed to go. There will inevitably be delays and problems, but that is common to all modes of transportation. The price is right (especially with a \\\"\"free\\\"\" bus pass; students see below) and if you live and work in the city, you should consider making the bus your main means of commuting.\\n\\nThe system is largely built on the legacy of pre-World War II trolley lines, so the neighborhoods that were developed before 1950 are fairly well-served, while more recent developments can be harder to navigate by bus. The system just had a major overhaul (in spring 2010) but still travel many of the same routes.\\n\\nThe route numbering system is complicated, and there are many exceptions, but as a rule, the routes are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion from downtown. The \\\"\"oughts\\\"\" and 10's go north, the 20's and 30's go west, the 40's and 50's go south, and the 60's, 70's, 80's an 90's go east. Routes that are just letters are express or flyer routes, which may go on one of three \\\"\"busways,\\\"\" transit-only highways that bypass traffic jams. The light rail (known as the \\\"\"T\\\"\" or the trolley) serves southern city and suburban neighborhoods above ground, and has three underground stations downtown, with a major construction project underway to extend trains to the North Side, projected for completion in 2011.\\n\\nThe University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (among others) have agreements with the Port Authority to allow students, staff and faculty to use their university IDs as bus passes. Others can purchase passes at $75 per month or $20 per week, while a local one-way fare is $2.00. Port Authority is supposed to be rolling out a \\\"\"smart card\\\"\" digital payment system (\\u00e0 la WMATA's SmarTrip or London's Oyster) soon, but that remains in development.\\n\\nOne especially great value is the 28X, a route serving the Pittsburgh International Airport from Downtown and Oakland (the university district) via the West Busway. Fare, as of mid-2010, is $2.75, compared with taxis and other shuttles costing $30 or more. The 28X runs every half hour and takes around 35 minutes to get to the airport from downtown, or 15 minutes longer from Oakland.\\n\\nThe Port Authority's fare revenues cover only a fraction of its expenses, and the state and county's perennial budget problems have caused several funding crises in recent years.\n\n\n[Succeeded / Failed / Skipped / Total] 85 / 1 / 5 / 91:  91%|▉| 91/100 [02:11<00--------------------------------------------- Result 92 ---------------------------------------------\n\u001b[92m2 (83%)\u001b[0m --> \u001b[91m1 (58%)\u001b[0m\n\nThe store is small, but it carries specialties that are difficult to find in \u001b[92mPittsburgh\u001b[0m.

After I explained that I'd never been there, he brought me a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for 10 minutes.  I walked again.  No more tries here.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong?  Haha.\n\n\n[Succeeded / Failed / Skipped / Total] 93 / 1 / 5 / 99: 100%|█| 100/100 [02:38<0--------------------------------------------- Result 100 ---------------------------------------------\n\u001b[91m1 (99%)\u001b[0m --> \u001b[92m2 (58%)\u001b[0m\n\nThis \u001b[91mplace\u001b[0m holds a nostalgic \u001b[91mappeal\u001b[0m for people born and raised in Pittsburgh who grew up eating here.
