It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?

When I showed him how my irrigation box was leaking, he knew right away what to do - he went a grabbed a new part out of his truck, put it on, and it was fixed! He then set up my watering timer and we talked about some landscaping and pricing. His prices seemed great and I will definitely use him in the future! To top it all off, when I asked him what I owed him for fixing my irrigation leak and his time, he said don't worry about it! I was shocked and couldn't believe his service!

I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \\\"\"Are you working?\\\"\" and they gave each other a weird look.

I went in with the intention of buying a jacket, helmet and gloves. Their store is pretty nice inside, and they have a good selection of gear (mostly dirt-oriented though). \\n\\nI wasn't quite sure what I wanted, so I asked a lady for some assistance in picking out a helmet. She was helpful, and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather. However, a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket (which they also sold), and she commented that the \\\"\"hated\\\"\" that jacket and that the liner was \\\"\"nothing more than a glorified garbage bag.\\\"\" Ok...\\n\\nWe also talked to a guy at the register about a '96 KTM 300 MXC that my friend just bought, and asked a simple question about a clutch cable. The guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless, and I'm not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was. He ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old. What!?\\n\\nEven after that, I still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet I liked that they had assured me would be in later that week. I then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available, but that I could pick another style. I then just ordered the helmet online and went back the next day to get a refund.\\n\\nI wanted to like this place, but between the thinly-veiled insults and seemingly clueless repair staff, I don't think I'll ever return. Their prices and selection are pretty decent, so if you are in the area and know what you want, it might be OK to stop by and pick something up. If you have any alternative, though, I would avoid this place.\n\n\n[Succeeded / Failed / Skipped / Total] 50 / 0 / 2 / 52:  53%|▌| 53/100 [03:48<03--------------------------------------------- Result 53 ---------------------------------------------\n\u001b[92m2 (100%)\u001b[0m --> \u001b[91m1 (58%)\u001b[0m\n\n\u001b[92mFun\u001b[0m bar, and instead of typical bar food they lean towards Greek dishes.

I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\\n\\nAnd I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \\\"\"what's going on here\\\"\" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\\n\\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\\n\\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \\\"\"Uh-oh\\\"\".  The menu is huge with a number of \\\"\"slow-food\\\"\" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\\n\\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \\n\\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\\n\\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \\\"\"bacon\\\"\" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \\\"\"meat\\\"\".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \\n\\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \\\"\"The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\\\"\".\\n\\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\\n\\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \\n\\nI'll never return.\n\nDespite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.  \\n\\nMy initial impression of the restaurant was \u001b[92mpropitious\u001b[0m - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.

The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\\n\\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \\\"\"bacon\\\"\" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \\\"\"meat\\\"\".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \\n\\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \\\"\"The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\\\"\".\\n\\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\\n\\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \\n\\nI'll never return.\n\n\n[Succeeded / Failed / Skipped / Total] 52 / 0 / 2 / 54:  55%|▌| 55/100 [03:55<03--------------------------------------------- Result 55 ---------------------------------------------\n\u001b[92m2 (99%)\u001b[0m --> \u001b[91m1 (61%)\u001b[0m\n\n\u001b[92mFirst\u001b[0m \u001b[92mtime\u001b[0m customer today.  \u001b[92mIt\u001b[0m is truly a dive but the sandwiches are \u001b[92mgreat\u001b[0m.

My great grandmother's sauce was the first I remember, she never opened a can to make her sauces, always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars. She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later adding whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.\\n\\nSorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No! I will admit it's good in a fit of really, REALLY needing a pasta fix, or if you want to eat breadstick and salad. But the sauces are overly rich, and I don't mean the tomato sauces. I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken, beef or fish. And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.\\n\\nOkay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers. But seriously, if you want good Italian food, hit up a REALLY good neighborhood, family owned Italian restaurant. The service is better, it will be cheaper and it won't go to a big conglomerate who over charges on a plate of pasta, which is one of the cheapest food you can serve. Oh, two stars for a pretty good bowl of Pasta Fazoo (pasta and beans).\n\n\n[Succeeded / Failed / Skipped / Total] 78 / 0 / 4 / 82:  83%|▊| 83/100 [04:14<00--------------------------------------------- Result 83 ---------------------------------------------\n\u001b[92m2 (100%)\u001b[0m --> \u001b[91m1 (87%)\u001b[0m\n\n\u001b[92mGreat\u001b[0m \u001b[92mbagels\u001b[0m, sandwiches, soup, and coffee!\\nMy \u001b[92mfavorites\u001b[0m are the veg-out bagel sandwich, the bagel dog on onion, and their sour cream potato salad is so good too.\\nIf you like all beef hotdogs, you should try the bagel dog.

Instead of running school buses, the school district gave high schoolers bus passes to get to class, and I have used the bus since 1997.\\n\\nI've had a great experience using the bus in Pittsburgh. I didn't get a driver's license until I was almost 19--the bus (\\\"\"Miss Pat\\\"\"--another nickname) and my bike got me everywhere I needed to go. There will inevitably be delays and problems, but that is common to all modes of transportation. The price is right (especially with a \\\"\"free\\\"\" bus pass; students see below) and if you live and work in the city, you should consider making the bus your main means of commuting.\\n\\nThe system is largely built on the legacy of pre-World War II trolley lines, so the neighborhoods that were developed before 1950 are fairly well-served, while more recent developments can be harder to navigate by bus. The system just had a major overhaul (in spring 2010) but still travel many of the same routes.\\n\\nThe route numbering system is complicated, and there are many exceptions, but as a rule, the routes are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion from downtown. The \\\"\"oughts\\\"\" and 10's go north, the 20's and 30's go west, the 40's and 50's go south, and the 60's, 70's, 80's an 90's go east. Routes that are just letters are express or flyer routes, which may go on one of three \\\"\"busways,\\\"\" transit-only highways that bypass traffic jams. The light rail (known as the \\\"\"T\\\"\" or the trolley) serves southern city and suburban neighborhoods above ground, and has three underground stations downtown, with a major construction project underway to extend trains to the North Side, projected for completion in 2011.\\n\\nThe University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (among others) have agreements with the Port Authority to allow students, staff and faculty to use their university IDs as bus passes. Others can purchase passes at $75 per month or $20 per week, while a local one-way fare is $2.00. Port Authority is supposed to be rolling out a \\\"\"smart card\\\"\" digital payment system (\\u00e0 la WMATA's SmarTrip or London's Oyster) soon, but that remains in development.\\n\\nOne especially great value is the 28X, a route serving the Pittsburgh International Airport from Downtown and Oakland (the university district) via the West Busway. Fare, as of mid-2010, is $2.75, compared with taxis and other shuttles costing $30 or more. The 28X runs every half hour and takes around 35 minutes to get to the airport from downtown, or 15 minutes longer from Oakland.\\n\\nThe Port Authority's fare revenues cover only a fraction of its expenses, and the state and county's perennial budget problems have caused several funding crises in recent years.\n\n\n[Succeeded / Failed / Skipped / Total] 86 / 0 / 5 / 91:  91%|▉| 91/100 [04:26<00--------------------------------------------- Result 92 ---------------------------------------------\n\u001b[92m2 (87%)\u001b[0m --> \u001b[91m1 (51%)\u001b[0m\n\nThe store is \u001b[92msmall\u001b[0m, but it carries specialties that are difficult to find in Pittsburgh.

(Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  \\n\\nI will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food.\n\n\n[Succeeded / Failed / Skipped / Total] 92 / 0 / 5 / 97:  97%|▉| 97/100 [04:49<00--------------------------------------------- Result 98 ---------------------------------------------\n\u001b[92m2 (99%)\u001b[0m --> \u001b[91m1 (58%)\u001b[0m\n\n\u001b[92mWhen\u001b[0m there's this much hype about a place, it's hard to live up to, but they \u001b[92mdid\u001b[0m a pretty \u001b[92mdamn\u001b[0m \u001b[92mgood\u001b[0m \u001b[92mjob\u001b[0m. \u001b[92mMaybe\u001b[0m not the best sandwich I've ever had in my life, but if it was any random sandwich shop I'd happened to stumble into, it would definitely be five stars without a second thought.\\n\\nThe chili cheese fries were among the best I've ever had.

But they don't mean the typical mayo-and-carrot-and-purple-onion coleslaw; they make it with vinegar and oil, so it's basically just like seasoned lettuce. They put a bit much of it on, which overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients at first, but just pull about half of the slaw off and you have a kick-ass sandwich. The hot sauce goes really well on it too. And for a pretty reasonable price, I might add. Normally, I'd expect it to be about twice as much with that kind of reputation and downtown location.\n\n\u001b[91mEverytime\u001b[0m there's this much hype about a place, it's hard to live up to, but they \u001b[91mhad\u001b[0m a pretty \u001b[91mfuck\u001b[0m \u001b[91mokay\u001b[0m \u001b[91mworkplace\u001b[0m. \u001b[91mAllegedly\u001b[0m not the best sandwich I've ever had in my life, but if it was any random sandwich shop I'd happened to stumble into, it would definitely be five stars without a second thought.\\n\\nThe chili cheese fries were among the best I've ever had.
